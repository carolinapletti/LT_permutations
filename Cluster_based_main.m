% permutation tests for fNIRS wavelet transform coherence data

% for interaction data: irrespective of group, compare all participants
% with random pairs (first calculate the random pairs)
% difference between real pairs and averaged random permutation pairs will
% tell us in which frequencies and time points there where differences
% between real interacting participants and fake participants pairs -> so
% it's a t-test, not an ANOVA!

% for video data: compare participants watching videos together with
% participants watching videos separately (since they are practically the
% same as randomly permuted pairs - same stimuli but they don't even see
% each other) -> again t-test, not ANOVA!

% for interaction data:
